## Project Structure

- **data**: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the models.
- **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, EDA, model building, and evaluation.
- **README.md**: The file you're currently reading, providing an overview of the project.
- **requirements.txt**: List of Python dependencies needed to run the project.
- **LICENSE**: Information about the project's open-source license.

## Dependencies

The project relies on several Python libraries and packages. You can install these dependencies using `pip` and the provided `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Collection & Preprocessing

- The project starts with importing the necessary libraries and dependencies.
- It loads the dataset from a CSV file and performs basic data preprocessing tasks, such as handling missing data.
- Categorical variables are encoded into numerical values.
- Data is split into training and testing sets.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Exploratory Data Analysis is conducted to gain insights into the dataset.
- Visualizations are created to understand the relationships between different features and the target variable.

## Model Building

- Several machine learning models are trained, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest.
- Models are trained on the training data and used for predictions.

## Model Evaluation

- The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on both the training and testing data.

## Feature Selection

- Feature selection is performed based on the importance scores obtained from a Decision Tree classifier.
- Selected features are used to train and evaluate models.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

- Hyperparameter tuning is conducted for the Random Forest model using GridSearchCV.
- The best set of hyperparameters is identified to optimize model performance.

## Usage

- To use the code and run the project, follow the instructions in the Jupyter notebooks provided in the `notebooks` folder.
- You can customize the code and adapt it to your specific dataset and problem.

## Contributing

Contributions and improvements to the project are welcome. If you have suggestions, bug reports, or want to add new features, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
